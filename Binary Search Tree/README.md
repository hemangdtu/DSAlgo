# Binary Search Tree
For a binary tree to be a binary search tree, the data of all the nodes in the left sub-tree of the root node should be <= the data of the root. The data of all the nodes in the right subtree of the root node should be > the data of the root.

#### Note
> Inorder Traversal of a BST always gives a sorted output/ series.
